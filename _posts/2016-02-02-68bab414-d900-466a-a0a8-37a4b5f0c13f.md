'I'm currently lucky enough to be working on some exciting animated and VFX short films, which I can't disclose at this time, however be sure to follow my twitter to keep up to date with what I'm up to. I love all things film, videogame and musical. I like keeping up to date with the latest releases within the gaming industry and often arrange my favourites for my Trend Orchestra, I'm obssesed with TV boxsets and will listen to anything from house music all the way to film soundtracks.'
